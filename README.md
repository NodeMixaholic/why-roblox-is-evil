# why-roblox-is-evil
Roblox is an online game development and playing software that is targeted at kids. But it seems like ROBLOX Studio has some shady practices that are worth noting.

Roblox’s “Terms of Service” (TOS) are exploitive and restrictive. Roblox claims the following: "You hereby irrevocably transfer and assign to Us all right, title, and interest in and to your Content." They sound so generous on first glance, but there's more on the terms of service page. Roblox claims the following: "You hereby grant us a perpetual, irrevocable, nonexclusive, royalty-free, fully paid, worldwide license (with the right to sublicense through unlimited levels of sublicensees) to use any or all of Your Content for any [reason]” 
Roblox is a company that is dedicated to exploiting its developers and making money off of them, and in order to do so it needs people to buy their useless in-game currency.

The ROBLOX Studio software, which is what you develop games in, is terrible and buggy. It crashes every few minutes to few hours and has a bunch of really bad bugs that even the developers can't fix. This has led many to find other software tools, such as Unity 3D or Unreal Engine 4. If you're thinking about buying robux, remember that it's just an exploit for the company to make more money. ROBUX always go back to the company’s pockets. Even if you try to create a place. 

Even if they claim you can make big money for creating a place, you most likely can not, because it’s an uphill battle that is rare to win. 
Plus, let’s just say the rich get richer and the poor get poorer because if you want to make your place popular you have to either get youtubers to endorse it (which requires you to pay the youtubers) or go through the lottery that is ROBLOX’s AD system (which requires you to pay ROBLOX in robux.) Also: ROBLOX takes a total 75% cut of worth of ROBUX via their sketchy developer payout program, and you need 1000 dollars of ROBUX to even start getting paid. This is compared to Steam's 30% and Epic's 15%.

The ROBLOX community is also criticized for being toxic, with many users being rude or just straight up abusive to others. This breaks Roblox's policies against abuse and bullying, but the company has taken very little action against these users so far.

Also worth noting: when Epic Games were suing Apple, one side (I forgot which, does not matter in this scenario) pointed out that external game stores were not allowed on the App Store, so ROBLOX changed their “games” to “experiences”, but we all know they are games. Very shady indeed.

ROBLOX has been the subject of much criticism for it's exploitative and shady practices, poor quality software, and toxic community.
